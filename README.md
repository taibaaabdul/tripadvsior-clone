# üåç TripViewer: A TripAdvisor Static UI Clone

## Project Overview

**TripViewer** is a meticulously crafted, static front-end clone of the TripAdvisor website's user interface. This project was built exclusively using **HTML5** for structure and **CSS3** for styling and layout.

The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate foundational front-end proficiency by replicating a complex, real-world website layout without relying on JavaScript, frameworks, or CSS preprocessors.

## üåü Features & Learning Outcomes

This project is a showcase of mastery over core web development fundamentals:

* **Semantic HTML5:** Use of appropriate elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.) to ensure a clean, accessible, and well-organized document structure.
* **Complex Layout Replication:** Successful creation of multi-column layouts, nested components (like review cards and listing panels), and sidebars, reflecting the complexity of the original site.
* **CSS Fundamentals:** Expertise in applying core CSS concepts, including:
    * The **Box Model** (margins, padding, borders).
    * Basic layout techniques (e.g., `float`, `inline-block`, or initial **Flexbox** implementation).
    * Visual styling (colors, typography, shadows, and hover effects).
* **Visual Fidelity:** Attention to detail in replicating the look, feel, and hierarchical flow of the original TripAdvisor UI.
